froot
=====

A frooty Java data scrambler! And we know that's not how you spell fruit.

### But what is it?

Give it some data, tell it what to scramble, and you get a tasty equivalent for that data!

### Does it have to be fruit?

No, you can give us any file, with any random data and we'll scramble anyway. But fruits are cool.

### Is it easy?

Yes.
